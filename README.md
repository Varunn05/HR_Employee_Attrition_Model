# HR_Employee_Attrition_Model

This project focuses on developing a HR Employee Attrition Model
using machine learning techniques. The objective is to accurately
why employees are leaving the company.

# It involves:

• Data Preprocessing: Collecting the data, handling null values, outlier
detection, label encoding.

• Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Plotting various graphs to understand
the data.

• Model Building: Splitting the data into training an testing sets, scaling.

• Model Evaluation: Using algorithms to evaluate the performance of the
model such as, training time, accuracy, AUC score.

• Following are the tools, libraries and packages used in this project:
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Statsmodels,
 SciPy, Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda.
